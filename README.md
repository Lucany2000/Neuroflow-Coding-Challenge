# Neuroflow-Coding-Challenge
REST API for the Neuroflow coding challenge
# Setting up the app
Set up a python environment and run pip install -r requirements.txt
Open a command prompt, by typing cmd in the search bar on the lower left, and then run the create_db.py python file, followed by the app.py file.
Once the create_db.py file has been ran, that file is no longer needed unless the database file is deleted

# Steps
While in the command prompt, copy and paste the link into a Chrome browser.
Once at the login screen, type in these credentials: Username=john_doe123, Password=P45Sw0rd
Passed the login screen you will be prompted the question of how you feel and from there you cam type anything in.
Once something is typed in and sent to the database, the item cannot be changed and new items cannot be added until the next day.

# Things to be done differently
If this was a production application instead of an assignment, I would have first added better security for logging in as well as a way to create an account. I would have also decided to do this in a virtual enviroment. Tech wouldn't change though I do believe that the html pages would've been swapped to either sample pages of current pages.
The create an account function would create a database table per person as well as if there was more data, then the ability to reload the database without losing information would be next.
